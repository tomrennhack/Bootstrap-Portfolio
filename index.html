                        <p>The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves. Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays. Roy Orbison singing for the lonely, hey that's me and I want you only, don't turn me home again I just can't face myself alone again. Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for. So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore. Show a little faith, there's magic in the night. You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright, oh and that's alright with me.</p>

                        <p>You can hide beneath your covers and study your pain, make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain, waste your summer praying in vain for a savior to rise from these streets. Well now I'm no hero, thats understood. All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood. With a chance to make it good somehow, hey what else can we do now except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair. Well the night's busting open these two lanes can take us anywhere. We got one last chance to make it real, to trade in these wings on some wheels. Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks. Oh-oh come take my hand, we're riding out tonight to case the promised land. Oh-oh-oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road. Lying out there like a killer in the sun. Hey I know it's late, we can make it if we run. Oh-oh-oh oh Thunder Road. Sit tight. Take hold. Thunder Road!</p>

                        <p>Well I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk, and my car's out back if you're willing to take that long walk from your front porch to my front seat, the door's open but the ride ain't free, and I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken, but tonight we'll be free, all the promises will be broken. There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away. They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned our Chevrolets. They scream your name at night in the street. Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet, and in the lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on, but when you get to teh porch they're gone on the wind, so Mary, climb in. It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling outta here to win!</p>
